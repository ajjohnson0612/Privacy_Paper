\section{Abstract}
\small
\textit{
    With many different Search engines available to browse the modern day internet, we show the difference in tracking done from the search engines and how they show targeted advertisement based on what was searched for by the user. By typing in different key words to a search engine and recording whether the keywords showed up in advertisements while tracking after how many searches the ads appeared. We found that the search engine DuckDuckGo had the least amount of advertisement shown for the keywords entered. }    

\section{Introduction}

\section{Design}
For the design of our experiment, we decided to manually type in the keywords into the search engine to maintain consistency with an average user for any of these services. To conduct the experiment, we set up a virtual machine with a fresh install of the latest stable release of Mozilla FireFox to remove all possibility of previous searches potentially influencing the shown Advertisement. For the experiment we created a list of eleven different key words that were used as key words to enter to they search engines.
